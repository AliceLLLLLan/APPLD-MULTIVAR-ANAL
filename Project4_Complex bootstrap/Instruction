•Determine which is the master program
•Find a data set with 1 continuous dependent variable and 6 or more continuous independent variables (Auto in ISLR will do).
•Split it along 1 variable, 9/10 and 1/10 (so 90% below a cut off, 10% above a cutoff.
•Provide me the predictions and confidence bounds for the mean of the prediction  for the 1/10 vs the true values (1/10 is xnew, 9/10 is x). Xaxis is predicted Y,  y, and bounds plotted against the Y axis. (do this both with leaps and with lars)
•Think about prediction bounds from elementary regression and discuss what you think may be going on in your plots. (what variability might be missing from your plots).
